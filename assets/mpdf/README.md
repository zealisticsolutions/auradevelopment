3. Then run example PHP files either from command line or from the browser
    - In the command line, the files are sent to `stdout`, the most convenient is to redirect them to file with `>` operator
    - In the browser, the output is sent inline to the browser so it should display in default PDF viewer

There is a generated list of example links for browser in the repository index.php file.
